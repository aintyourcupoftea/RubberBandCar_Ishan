# Project Level 1: Rubber Band Car (Make Charles Proud!)

## Step 1: Building the Car
Let your creativity shine as you assemble a car using ice-cream sticks, a straw, bottle cap, and glue. The challenge? Design a car that optimizes the use of a rubber band and wheel axle structure. Experiment with unconventional designs, pushing the limits of what's possible with limited resources. Say goodbye to traditional designs and hello to innovation!
